Trying to learn how Processing 3 works by programming a simple verple of the "Pong" game


Unsolved Errors:
	There is a colissions problem when the ball touches the wall and the 
	paddle corner at the same time. The ball gets stuck in the wall.
	The app crashes when you go back to the menu from the game and you change
	the selected ball. You get and ArraIndexOutOfBounds: -2 exception when 
	changing the ball texture. I get it on different planets and it's very random.
